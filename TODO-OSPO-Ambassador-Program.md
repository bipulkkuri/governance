To become an Ambassador, an individual must review and meet the current requirements. We invite you to [submit your application for consideration](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/issues/new/choose) if you meet the requirements.

### How does changing organizations or ceasing activities within an organization affect Ambassador status?

The Ambassador title is granted to an individual, regardless of their affiliation. Thus, moving to a different organization or ceasing activities in a given organization does not affect the Ambassador's title unless the individual determines to no longer be able to commit to the duties of a TODO OSPO Ambassador.

### How long does my ambassadorship last?

All ambassadorships will be a two-year commitment. For example, an Ambassador accepted in November 2023 will serve until November 2025.
